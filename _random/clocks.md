I like clocks! And I like wasting my time!

So I made some clock faces:

  - [Digital clock with character morphing](https://clocks.fbbdev.it/orologiaDig/){:target="_blank"}
  - [Analog clock with a cool effect](https://clocks.fbbdev.it/orologia/){:target="_blank"}

Done in [*p5.js*](https://p5js.org/){:target="_blank"}
with the help of [*opentype.js*](https://opentype.js.org){:target="_blank"}
and [*flubber*](https://github.com/veltman/flubber){:target="_blank"}.
