I like clocks! And I like wasting my time!

So I made some clock faces:

  - [Digital clock with character morphing](https://clocks.fbbdev.it/orologiaDig/)
  - [Analog clock with a cool effect](https://clocks.fbbdev.it/orologia/)

Done in [*p5.js*](https://p5js.org/)
with the help of [*opentype.js*](https://opentype.js.org)
and [*flubber*](https://github.com/veltman/flubber).
