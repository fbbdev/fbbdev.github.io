Since our beloved fastcgi.com died, I recovered the original pages from
the wayback machine and created an unofficial website for the FastCGI spec.
The website hosts both the original fastcgi.com spec page and a nicely
formatted version, manually cleaned up and converted to markdown.

There is also a dedicated Github organization and a repository (linked above)
with markdown and HTML source code. Issues and pull requests are always
welcome; of course I won't change the text of the spec, but I will fix typos
and improve formatting.
