Teachers and tutors of theoretical computer science courses often face the dual
problem of *(a)* helping novice students to become acquainted with the somewhat
counterintuitive discipline of Turing machine design and interpretation, and on
the other hand *(b)* interpreting and assessing their students' output which
— due to the aforementioned lack of intuition — can often get quite convoluted
itself.

This project is an attempt at developing tools that may help solve both sides
of the problem; first, by providing a graphical environment in which the
structure and behavior of machine designs can be visualized and explored
intuitively; second, by providing tools for assisted (and partially automated)
analysis of their behavior in terms of a higher level description language.

It grew out of dissatisfaction with the tools already available on the internet,
which are either too inflexible (i.e. limited in their functionality) or sport
outdated and/or uncomfortable user interfaces.

This is a browser-based application. A fully functional build is available
[here](https://fbbdev.it/turing/). Useful information and examples can be found
in the [README](https://github.com/fbbdev/turing/#readme) file on GitHub.
