Hello! I am Fabio Massaioli (a.k.a. _fbbdev_), a freelance software developer and PhD candidate from Italy.

I have been learning and practicing computer programming with various languages and technologies
for almost 20 years, first as a hobby and later through freelance work for small businesses.

## Education

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Logic at [_Scuola Normale Superiore_](https://www.sns.it){:target="_blank"}
in Pisa, Italy. My research area is [_structural proof theory_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_proof_theory){:target="_blank"},
a beautiful field at the intersection of logic and theoretical computer science.

I hold a Master Degree in Philosophy from [_Roma Tre_ University](https://www.uniroma3.it/){:target="_blank"}
in Roma, Italy. At first I studied mainly ethics, philosophical anthropology and medieval
philosophy, then I moved on to the philosophy of science and logic.

## Research

Structural proof theory studies patterns of reasoning and rules of inference, and the interactions
that arise between them when they are combined to form complex systems. It borrows techniques
from the _theory and semantics of programming languages_, as well as from _computability_ and
_complexity theory_. It contributes back to computer science techniques for _improving software
correctness_, like _typing systems_ and formal methods for _program verification_.

Some of my research output is available at the [writings page](/writings).

## Experience

My freelance work has been mostly with small and individual businesses, developing software
tools to improve their workflow or helping them set up their internal networking and online
presence.

**Since 2020** I've been developing and maintaining the virtual classroom implementation
(video-conferencing UI and backend interaction code) at [uwmeeting.com](https://www.uwmeeting.com/),
a distance learning platform targeted to musicians and optimized for high-quality audio.

**Since 2019** I've been developing and maintaining dedicated management software for
[Laura Costanzo](https://www.informazione-aziende.it/Azienda_COSTANZO-LAURA-F389C) a local
distributor specializing in [vine plants](https://www.vivairauscedo.com). The software
tracks customers, orders, incoming and outgoing shipments and warehouse status.

**From 2014 to 2020** I've privately tutored students in Computer Science from the universities
[Tor Vergata](http://web.uniroma2.it){:target="_blank"} and [Sapienza](https://www.uniroma1.it){:target="_blank"}
in Roma, Italy. I was delighted to see them graduate with great results
and/or go on to start their own careers
in this field, and I am honored to have been able to contribute to their success.

**From 2012 to 2013** I developed and managed software for the annual quality assessment survey
[at my high school](https://www.scuolamausiliatriceroma.org/), both for the collection phase,
and for the subsequent aggregated data analysis.

## Open-source software

I develop and maintain some open-source projects, and over the years I have made contributions
to projects by other people. Some of my own are listed [here](/projects), while others, as well
as the list of contributions, are available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/fbbdev){:target="_blank"}.

I am especially proud of [a major contribution](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3468) to the upcoming [v3](https://v3alpha.wails.io/) of the beautiful [Wails](https://wails.io/) project, which provides lovers of the Go programming language with a comprehensive framework to create cross-platform, web-based Desktop applications. I implemented and currently contribute to the maintenance of the internal Go to JS binding generator, that allows seamless interoperation of JavaScript and Go code.

I am currently the maintainer of [`node-fastcgi`](/projects/node-fastcgi), an [npm
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fastcgi){:target="_blank"} supporting the
development of FastCGI applications in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org){:target="_blank"}.
This project has enjoyed some success as it is useful to people stuck with inflexible shared
hosting environments.
