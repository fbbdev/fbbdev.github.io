This master's thesis (in Italian) explores various normalization procedures
(also known as cut-elimination procedures, from Gentzen's original work on the
subject&nbsp;\[[4](#Gen35)\]) in sequent-style deductive systems for classical logic.
In the&nbsp;4<sup>th</sup> and main chapter of the thesis I adapt a proof
technique by Barbanera and Berardi&nbsp;\[[2](#BB96)\] to obtain a strong
normalization result for a variant of Gentzen's non-deterministic cut-elimination
procedure for the sequent calculus LK, as defined in&nbsp;\[[3](#DJS97),[1](#AT14)\].
This opens the door to a direct investigation of the computational content of
symmetric reduction procedures for classical sequent calculus.

_Note:_ it turned out that the same result had already been published by Urban
and Bierman in&nbsp;\[[5](#UB01)\], a paper I had missed during my survey of
relevant literature. Although my work is similar to theirs even in very small
details, it was an independent rediscovery, and in fact some technical choices
helped me avoid a (non-critical) mistake that was present in&nbsp;\[[5](#UB)\].
