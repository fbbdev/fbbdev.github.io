## Abstract

It is often believed that christian thinkers, and especially medieval ones,
conceive of love either — negatively — as a contemptible passion, a morally
disordered appetite for one's own gratification, or — positively — as virtuous
form of abnegation, a holy disposition to complete self-sacrifice in the
service of God's will and the good of others. Orthogonally, western culture
is inclined to think of love (in both senses) as a completely irrational
force, often at odds with the conclusions of pragmatic, rigorous thought.
Such opinions appear both in popular culture and in the intellectual sphere:
consider for example the Rationalist and Romantic schools of philosophy.

This undergraduate dissertation in Medieval Philosophy (in Italian)
investigates the concept of love in the works of medieval philosophers
and theologians Augustine of&nbsp;Hippo (354–430 AD) and Thomas Aquinas
(1225–1274 AD). While they often offer differing perspectives on the same
subjects, both thinkers present love as a unifying concept, tying together
the three spheres of life: the biological, the psychological and the
intellectual. This runs directly counter to the ideas recalled above.
Aquinas in particular explores and emphasizes the traits of love in the
intellectual sphere of life, grounding it in the knowledge and understanding
of people and the world around us. Love is — in other words — not an opposite
of reason, but a different and complementary mode of it: one focused on the
concrete and actual over the abstract and hypothetic, acting as the bridge
between theoretical and practical judgement, and deeply intertwined with
the psychological sphere of affectivity.
