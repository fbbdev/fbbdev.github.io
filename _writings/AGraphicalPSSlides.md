These are the slides accompanying the talk I gave within the Logic Group seminar at Scuola
Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, on May 15<sup>th</sup>, 2023. They present some unpublished
work (still in progress) about a graphical proof-system for classical logic (in the style
of proof-nets).

## Abstract

We recall briefly the origins and significance of the problem of proof identity
in classical logic, then proceed to show why extensional approaches are bound
to fail and discuss an abstract method proposed in older and more recent
literature to account for the intensional features of proof systems.

We introduce a graphical proof system (i.e., proofs are represented as graphs)
for classical propositional logic, where the logical rule permutations of
classical sequent calculus are reduced to identities and the invertibility of
logical rules follows from easy and efficient constructions. The same
constructions establish a direct correspondence between this system and the
cut-free fragment of the sequent calculus GS4, thus providing an account of
the content of GS4 derivations up to arbitrary rule permutations, in the sense
specified at the beginning of the talk. We then refine the structure of our
graph-based proofs in a non-trivial way, allowing us to provide an interesting
cut-elimination algorithm, and show that the new system provides a rich
invariant of the cut-elimination process in an augmented version of GS4.

Finally, we compare our work with previous attempts, and discuss possible
applications and future developments.
