# What are cookies?

Cookies are small strings of text stored on your device when you visit
a website. They enable the website to remember your actions and
preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display
preferences) over a period of time, so you donâ€™t have to keep
re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse
from one page to another.
